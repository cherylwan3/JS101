/**
 * casual pseudocode: 
 * 
 * Welcome user to the calculator.
 * 
 * -Prompt user for the loan amount and save that value.
 * -Prompt user for the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) and save that value. 
 * -Divide the APR by twelve and save that value as the monthly interest rate. 
 * -Prompt the user for the loan duration in years and save that value. 
 * -Multiply the loan duration in years by twelve and save that value as the 
 * loan duration in months.
 * 
 * Then enter all the saved values into the mortgage rate formula to 
 * calculate the monthly payment.
 * 
 * Convert the monthly payment into dollars and cents amount and log 
 * that to the console.
 * 
 * 
 * Formal Pseudocode:
 * START
 * 
 * GET loanAmount
 * SET loanAmount
 *
 * // check for positive integer 
 * WHILE invalidInteger
 *  GET loanAmount
 * 
 * // check for positive integer 
 * Get annualPercentageRate // account for 0
 * SET annualPercentageRate
 * 
 * WHILE invalidAnnualPercentageRate
 *  GET annualPercentageRate
 * 
 * SET monthlyInterestRate
 * monthlyInterestRate = annualPercentageRate / 12 
 *
 * GET loanDurationInYears
 * SET loanDurationInYears
 * 
 * WHILE invalidLoanDurationInYears
 *  GET loanDurationInYears
 * 
 * 
 * SET loanDurationInMonths
 * loanDurationInMonths = loanDurationInYears * 12 
 * 
 * SET monthlyPayment;
 * 
 * IF annualPercentageRate  === 0 
 *  monthlyPayment = loanAmount / loanDurationInMonths
 * ELSE
  * monthlyPayment = loanAmount * 
  * (monthlyInterestRate / (1 - Math.pow((1 + monthlyInterestRate), 
  * (-loanDurationInMonths))));
 * 
 * SET monthlyPaymentInDollars
